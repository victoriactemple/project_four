# PROJECT FOUR
## GEORGIA STATE PARKS 

## Georgia State Park Highlight:
Before attending GA, my finance and I hiked every weekend. We've been to dozens of parks in every pockets of Georgia. One of the more frustrating things about this experience is finding up-to-date and honest information about the parks and their trails. When you do find information about the park, it's usually attached to a website from the 1990s.  - Enter Georgia State Park Highlights. Here I've compiled a short list of the top best state parks in Georgia, with each park containing a list of user submitted trails and comments on those trails.
