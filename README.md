# PROJECT FOUR
## GEORGIA STATE PARKS 

## Georgia State Park Highlight:
Before attending GA, my finance and I hiked every weekend. We've been to dozens of parks in every pockets of Georgia. One of the more frustrating things about this experience is finding up-to-date and honest information about the parks and their trails. When you do find information about the park, it's usually attached to a website from the 1990s.  - Enter Georgia State Park Highlights. Here I've compiled a short list of the top best state parks in Georgia, with each park containing a list of user submitted trails and comments on those trails.

#### For the Future - Version Two:
1. Fixing the nav-bar links and sticky footer
2. Validation of the user so that when they are not signed in and they try to leave a comment, they are prompted to sign in. 
3. User's profile page -- showing them their name and their information should they need to edit or change information. 
4. Rate the comments -- say if something was helpful or not. 
5. Some items have been hard coded in, like the difficulty level and if pets are allowed or not on the trail and I would like to change those to be multiple choice and booleans respectively.
